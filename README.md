# LazyNvim config for me

I switched from kickstart to LazyVim because I started using Omarchy

## Introduction

My config for neovim, I think I am somewhere in the middle between minimal and full IDE.

## Installation

### Install Neovim

I use *only* the latest
['stable'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/stable) and latest
['nightly'](https://github.com/neovim/neovim/releases/tag/nightly) of Neovim.
If you are experiencing issues, please make sure you have the latest versions.

### Install External Dependencies

External Requirements:

- Basic utils: `git`, `make`, `unzip`, C Compiler (`gcc`)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation),
  [fd-find](https://github.com/sharkdp/fd#installation)
- Clipboard tool (xclip/xsel/wl-clipboard)
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/): optional, provides various icons
  - if you have it set `vim.g.have_nerd_font` in `init.lua` to true
- Emoji fonts (Ubuntu only, and only if you want emoji!) `sudo apt install fonts-noto-color-emoji`
- Language Setup:
  - If you want to write Golang, you will need `go`
  - If you want to write Rust, you will need `rustup`
  - For Language Servers that aren't available via Mason, you will likely need `npm` and `python/pip`
